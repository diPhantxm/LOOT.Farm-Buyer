# [LOOT.Farm Buyer](https://www.loot.farm/)
I was using [CSGO.TM](https://market.csgo.com/) as a market place. That was my testing project for web data scraping. Since I got ban on my steam trading account, I decided to stop trading in steam.<br />
*It was taking around 5 minutes to go throught all items with the price of up to $0.2. It includes time of logging in, api request to get market prices and the process itself*
## How to use
1. Run the code
2. Log in your steam account in opened google chrome window
3. Press <Enter> in console
4. Wait until bot get the job done
## How to use your own marketplace
1. To create your own Market API, create a class and inherit APIBase abstract class and IAPIBase interface
2. Implement all the methods from interface
3. Replace my market api with yours in main program
